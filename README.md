# ai-driven-crack-detection-system
Developed a deep learning–based computer vision system to detect structural cracks in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and performance evaluation. Built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV for automated infrastructure inspection.
